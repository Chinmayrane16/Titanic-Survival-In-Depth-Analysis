# Titanic-Survival-In-Depth-Analysis
**The Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competiton.**
The purpose of this project was to use DL and ML implementations on a dataset to help and analyise a titanic survival scenario.
* With data being provided of varoius passengers traveling on the ship I have used libraries like _Numpy , Pandas_ to manipulate , explore and analyze the data.
* Also used Libraries like _Matplotlib and Seaborn_ to Visualise the data. 
* Lastly I have used various machine learning models to make predictions on the formerly cleaned and preprocessed data. 
* Then I used _GridSearchCV_ to optimise the parameters of the various models.
